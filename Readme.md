# CF SnowflakeID

A SnowflakeID is a unique, distributed identifier generated by the Twitter Snowflake algorithm, primarily used for ensuring unique IDs across a distributed system with high performance. It is best used for generating globally unique IDs in distributed databases, microservices architectures, and other systems where unique and scalable identification is essential.

This a ColdFusion based SnowflakeID generator, this was only built/tested with Lucee.


## How to use

```
snowflake = new snowflake().init(nodeId=1000);

mySnowflakeId = snowflake.nextId();

writedump(mySnowflakeId);
```
